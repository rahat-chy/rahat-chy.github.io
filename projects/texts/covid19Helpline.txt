Goal of this project was to help people by providing information and services at emergency moment. By this project, we tried to
provide all the important information like Plasma,Oxygen,Doctor,ICU and Ambulance at one platform related
 to COVID-19. At emergency moments people become more helpless and can not set their immediate action to
perform without proper information. Many lives can be saved by taking proper initiatives at the right time. We
wanted to perform that duty by providing correct information and contribute to overcome this pandemic
situation.<br><br>
